## 📖 Introduction

This project provides a complete toolchain to easily add residential proxy nodes to your Clash subscription configuration with flexible pre-routing options.

### 🎯 Problems Solved

- ✅ Streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ require real residential IPs.
- ✅ AI services like ChatGPT and OpenAI strictly limit datacenter IPs.
- ✅ Some websites detect and block datacenter IPs.
- ✅ Need for higher anonymity and authenticity.
